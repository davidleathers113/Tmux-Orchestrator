# Wave 1: Claude Code Compatibility & Integration

## Wave Focus
Analyzing fundamental compatibility between Tmux-Orchestrator and Claude Code's architecture, security model, and tool ecosystem integration.

## Key Reports

### 1. Claude Code Compatibility Analysis
**Finding**: Critical incompatibility - only 15% of features would work
- Process isolation conflicts prevent background management
- Security model violations in core orchestrator patterns
- Tool restrictions block tmux automation
- **Recommendation**: DO NOT attempt integration

### 2. Tool Ecosystem Integration Report
**Finding**: Poor integration across modern development tools
- 0% cross-platform support (macOS-only)
- 5% CI/CD compatibility due to security model
- 10% container compatibility with architecture conflicts
- Limited IDE/editor integration capabilities

### 3. Technical Conflicts Analysis
**Finding**: Fundamental architectural mismatches
- Permission system conflicts with agent spawning
- Background process management violates sandboxing
- Inter-agent communication blocked by security boundaries
- File system assumptions incompatible with containers

## Critical Takeaways

1. **Architectural Incompatibility**: The orchestrator's core assumptions about process management, file system access, and inter-process communication fundamentally conflict with Claude Code's security model.

2. **Security Model Violations**: Most orchestrator features would trigger security violations in Claude Code, including background process spawning, cross-session communication, and system-level tmux manipulation.

3. **Integration Impossibility**: Rather than being a matter of configuration or minor adjustments, the incompatibilities are architectural and would require complete system redesign to resolve.

## Wave Verdict
Claude Code integration is not feasible. Use Claude's native project management features or external orchestration tools for multi-agent workflows.
