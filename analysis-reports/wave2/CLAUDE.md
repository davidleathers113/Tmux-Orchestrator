# Wave 2: Security Architecture Deep Dive

## Wave Focus
Comprehensive security assessment examining attack vectors, defense mechanisms, and compliance requirements from a defensive security perspective.

## Key Reports

### 1. Attack Vector Research
**Finding**: 21 critical attack vectors with trivial exploitation
- Command injection in core scheduling scripts
- Tmux session hijacking pathways
- Privilege escalation through agent impersonation
- Persistent backdoor installation capabilities
- **Risk**: Zero-to-root in 30 seconds

### 2. Defense Mechanism Design
**Finding**: Complete security overhaul required
- Zero-trust architecture implementation needed
- Multi-layer authentication for agents required
- Encrypted inter-process communication essential
- Comprehensive audit trail infrastructure missing
- **Cost**: $4M+ over 36 months for remediation

### 3. Compliance Audit Analysis
**Finding**: Fails all major compliance frameworks
- SOC 2: 0/114 controls implemented
- ISO 27001: Critical non-conformities in all domains
- GDPR: No data protection measures
- HIPAA: Unsuitable for healthcare data
- **Legal Risk**: $2.5M-$5.0M annual exposure

## Critical Takeaways

1. **Zero Security Controls**: The system lacks even basic security measures like authentication, authorization, input validation, or secure communication channels.

2. **Trivial Exploitation**: Attack vectors are not theoretical - they represent practical, easily exploitable vulnerabilities that could be leveraged by any attacker with basic shell knowledge.

3. **Compliance Nightmare**: The security posture makes the system unsuitable for any regulated industry or organization with security requirements.

## Wave Verdict
Catastrophic security vulnerabilities require immediate system discontinuation. Complete redesign needed for any production use.
