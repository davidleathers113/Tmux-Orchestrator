# Security Documentation - Tmux Orchestrator Adapted Scripts

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the adapted Tmux Orchestrator scripts. These measures are designed to prevent common security vulnerabilities while maintaining the functionality of the original scripts.

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

1. **Command Injection**
   - Risk: Malicious commands passed through user input
   - Mitigation: Input sanitization, command whitelisting

2. **Path Traversal**
   - Risk: Access to files outside intended directories
   - Mitigation: Path validation, restricted file operations

3. **Resource Exhaustion**
   - Risk: Denial of service through resource consumption
   - Mitigation: Rate limiting, process limits, timeouts

4. **Unauthorized Access**
   - Risk: Commands sent to unintended tmux sessions
   - Mitigation: Session validation, access control lists

5. **Information Disclosure**
   - Risk: Sensitive data exposed in logs or error messages
   - Mitigation: Log sanitization, secure storage

## Security Controls

### Input Validation

All user inputs are validated using the following methods:

1. **Format Validation**
   ```bash
   # Session:window format
   ^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+:[0-9]+$
   ```

2. **Command Whitelisting**
   - Only commands in `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` array are permitted
   - Partial matching for command arguments
   - No shell metacharacters allowed

3. **Sanitization**
   - Remove: `;`, `|`, `&`, `` ` ``, `$`
   - Strip newlines and control characters
   - Escape special characters

### Access Control

1. **Session Restrictions**
   - Optional `ALLOWED_SESSIONS` configuration
   - Session existence validation
   - Window index verification

2. **Command Restrictions**
   - Whitelist-based command filtering
   - No arbitrary script execution
   - Limited to predefined operations

3. **File Access**
   - Restricted to configured directories
   - No symlink following
   - Secure temporary file creation

### Audit Logging

1. **Logged Events**
   - All command executions
   - Failed authorization attempts
   - Configuration changes
   - Error conditions

2. **Log Format**
   ```
   [TYPE] TIMESTAMP - Target: SESSION:WINDOW - Command: COMMAND - User: USER - Result: SUCCESS/FAILURE
   ```

3. **Log Protection**
   - Append-only log files
   - Rotation with retention policy
   - Secure permissions (640)

### Rate Limiting

1. **Command Throttling**
   - Maximum commands per minute: 30 (configurable)
   - Per-session limits available
   - Exponential backoff on violations

2. **Process Limits**
   - Maximum background processes: 5
   - Process timeout enforcement
   - Automatic cleanup of stale processes

## Configuration Security

### Secure Defaults

- Audit logging: Enabled
- Command validation: Enabled
- Dry run mode: Available
- Strict mode: Enabled

### Sensitive Data

- No passwords in configuration files
- Environment variables for secrets
- Secure file permissions (600)

## Operational Security

### Deployment

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   # Set secure permissions
   chmod 750 adapted-scripts/
   chmod 640 adapted-scripts/config/orchestrator.conf
   chmod 750 adapted-scripts/*.sh
   ```

2. **User Permissions**
   - Run with minimum required privileges
   - No setuid/setgid binaries
   - Separate user for automation

### Monitoring

1. **Security Events**
   - Monitor `error.log` for failures
   - Review `audit.log` for anomalies
   - Alert on rate limit violations

2. **Health Checks**
   ```bash
   # Check for suspicious activity
   grep "FAILED" logs/audit.log | tail -20
   
   # Monitor resource usage
   ps aux | grep tmux-orchestrator
   ```

### Incident Response

1. **Detection**
   - Log analysis scripts
   - Anomaly detection rules
   - Real-time alerts

2. **Response**
   - Kill suspicious processes
   - Revoke session access
   - Preserve logs for analysis

3. **Recovery**
   - Restore from configuration backup
   - Reset compromised sessions
   - Update security rules

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Regular Reviews**
   - Audit command whitelist monthly
   - Review access logs weekly
   - Update allowed sessions as needed

2. **Least Privilege**
   - Only whitelist necessary commands
   - Restrict session access
   - Use read-only where possible

3. **Defense in Depth**
   - Multiple validation layers
   - Fail-safe defaults
   - Regular security updates

### For Users

1. **Safe Usage**
   - Always use the adapted scripts
   - Report suspicious behavior
   - Keep configurations updated

2. **Avoid**
   - Bypassing security checks
   - Sharing configuration files
   - Running with elevated privileges

## Compliance

### Standards Alignment

- OWASP Secure Coding Practices
- CIS Security Benchmarks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### Audit Requirements

- Log retention: 30 days minimum
- Command attribution required
- Quarterly security reviews

## Security Updates

Check for updates regularly:
```bash
# Verify script integrity
sha256sum adapted-scripts/*.sh > checksums.txt
diff checksums.txt checksums.original
```

Report security issues to the maintainers through secure channels.
