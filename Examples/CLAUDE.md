# Visual Examples Documentation

## Purpose
This directory contains visual examples demonstrating secure orchestration patterns and proper tmux management workflows. These screenshots serve as reference implementations for AI agents.

## Example Files

### Initiate Project Manager.png
Shows the correct workflow for deploying a Project Manager agent to a session. Demonstrates proper window creation, agent briefing, and initialization sequence with security-first approach.

### Project Completed.png
Illustrates successful project completion patterns including:
- Final status reports with verification steps
- Proper git commit procedures
- Clean session termination
- Audit trail generation

### Reading TMUX Windows and Sending Messages.png
Demonstrates secure inter-agent communication:
- Using `tmux capture-pane` for monitoring
- Proper message formatting with validation
- Avoiding command injection vulnerabilities
- Rate limiting considerations

### Status reports.png
Shows standardized status reporting format:
- Structured update templates
- Progress tracking methodology
- Blocker identification patterns
- Security issue escalation

## Security Patterns Demonstrated

All examples emphasize:
- **Input validation** before executing commands
- **Structured communication** preventing injection attacks
- **Audit trails** for all agent actions
- **Least privilege** window access

## ⚠️ Warning
These examples show secure patterns that MUST NOT be bypassed. Any shortcuts or "optimizations" that skip validation steps create critical vulnerabilities. Always follow the complete workflows shown.
